  <project_name>BudgetAI - Smart Expense Tracker with AI Categorization</project_name>

  <overview>
    Build a comprehensive personal finance application with AI-powered expense categorization. The application
    leverages Claude API to automatically categorize transactions, analyze spending patterns, and provide
    intelligent budget recommendations. Features include multi-account management, budget tracking, savings
    goals, receipt scanning, and natural language queries for financial insights. The UI should be clean,
    modern, and finance-focused using Tailwind CSS with excellent data visualization and responsive design.
